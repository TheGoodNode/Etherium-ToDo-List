# Etherium-ToDo-List
Creating a To Do list app using BlockChain Technology

## Notes:

To run truffle:
`$ npm run dev`

To migrate contract:
`$ truffle migrate [--reset]`

--reset: is used when ganache is running with old contracts

`migrate`: means that it gives for every block the contract functionality

### Tools Used:

* Truffle
* Ganache
* MetaMask
